# Needlr

A location-first tattoo portfolio and booking platform for Montréal — the deliberate anti-Instagram for tattoo discovery.

The full product context lives in [`docs/`](./docs):

- [`PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`](./docs/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md) — what we're building and why
- [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — tech stack and layering rules
- [`DOMAIN_MODEL.md`](./docs/DOMAIN_MODEL.md) — entities and enums
- [`FEATURE_SPECS.md`](./docs/FEATURE_SPECS.md) — feature-level decisions
- [`BUILD_PLAN.md`](./docs/BUILD_PLAN.md) — ordered execution plan
- [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr) — architectural decision records (binding)
- [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — conventions and hard constraints

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) (9.0.313 or newer in the same feature band — see [`global.json`](./global.json))
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) — for the local Postgres + PostGIS container
- _(optional)_ A Stripe test account if you want to exercise the real card-collection flow; otherwise the FE falls back to a synthetic payment-method id and the test fixture's `FakeStripeService` covers the server side.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Start Postgres + PostGIS
docker compose up -d

# 2. Restore and build the solution
dotnet restore
dotnet build

# 3. Apply EF Core migrations
dotnet ef database update \
  --project src/Needlr.Infrastructure \
  --startup-project src/Needlr.Api

# 4. Run the API
dotnet run --project src/Needlr.Api

# 5. (separate terminal) Run the Blazor PWA client
dotnet run --project src/Needlr.Web
```

## Configuration

Sensitive values come from `appsettings.{Environment}.Local.json` (gitignored) or environment variables. Never commit secrets.

| Section | Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ConnectionStrings` | `Postgres` | Defaults to the `docker-compose.yml` container; override for hosted DBs |
| `Jwt` | `SigningKey` | 32+ bytes; rotate by republishing JWTs (refresh-token chain handles this) |
| `Jwt` | `Issuer`, `Audience`, `AccessTokenLifetimeMinutes`, `RefreshTokenLifetimeDays` | Standard JWT config |
| `Stripe` | `SecretKey` | Set to enable Connect onboarding + capture; without it `IStripeService` doesn't register |
| `Stripe` | `ConnectWebhookSigningSecret` | For verifying inbound `/api/webhooks/stripe` payloads |
| `Stripe` | `OnboardingReturnUrl`, `OnboardingRefreshUrl` | Where Stripe sends artists after the hosted KYC flow |
| `Hangfire` | `EnableServer` | `true` to start the recurring-job worker + dashboard at `/hangfire` |
| `ImageStorage` | `Backend` | `Local` (default) or `R2` |
| `ImageStorage` | `LocalRootPath` | Where the local backend writes blobs (default: `wwwroot/uploads`) |
| `Notifications` | `SendGridApiKey`, `FromEmail`, `FromName` | Optional; without `SendGridApiKey` the `IEmailSender` logs to the console. Verify the from-domain in SendGrid (Sender Authentication) before sending real mail. |
| `Notifications` | `VapidPublicKey`, `VapidPrivateKey`, `VapidSubject` | Optional Web Push config |

The Blazor client reads its own `wwwroot/appsettings.json`:

| Section | Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Api` | `BaseUrl` | API origin; defaults to the WASM host (same domain in prod) |
| `Stripe` | `PublishableKey` | `pk_test_…` or `pk_live_…`; empty key uses synthetic payment-method ids |

## Tests

```bash
# Full test suite (Domain + Application + Infrastructure + Architecture + Integration).
# Integration tests pull the postgis/postgis Docker image on first run.
dotnet test
```

The integration suite uses `Testcontainers.PostgreSql` against the `postgis/postgis:16-3.4` image. `WebAppFixture` wires the test host with deterministic test doubles for Stripe, push, email, Hangfire schedulers, and thread-lock scheduling — see [`tests/Needlr.Api.IntegrationTests/Fixtures/`](./tests/Needlr.Api.IntegrationTests/Fixtures).

End-to-end smoke: [`HappyPathTests`](./tests/Needlr.Api.IntegrationTests/EndToEnd/HappyPathTests.cs) walks customer signup → artist signup → booking request → accept → webhook → message exchange → completion → feedback in one stitched test.

Layering rules and project references are documented in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) § Layering rules.

## Conventions

See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for code style and the five hard product constraints.

The ADRs in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr) are binding product invariants:

1. ADR-001 — No social features
2. ADR-002 — No public reviews
3. ADR-003 — Message privacy and booking-scoped messaging
4. ADR-004 — Artist-managed studios (no `StudioOwner` role)
5. ADR-005 — Individual Stripe Connect accounts only

## Contributing

- One type per file. File-scoped namespaces. Nullable refs on. `TreatWarningsAsErrors` on for non-test projects.
- MediatR handlers carry the business logic; controllers are thin.
- Tests in [`Needlr.Architecture.Tests`](./tests/Needlr.Architecture.Tests) enforce the layering. They will fail your PR if Domain depends on anything beyond `NetTopologySuite.Geometries`.
- New features go in [`docs/FEATURE_SPECS.md`](./docs/FEATURE_SPECS.md) and the relevant phase in [`docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`](./docs/BUILD_PLAN.md) before being built. Don't introduce undocumented features.
- Commits: conventional-commits style (`feat(scope): …`, `chore: …`, etc.).

## Deployment

The v1 deploy target is a single DigitalOcean droplet running Caddy + the API
container + PostgreSQL+PostGIS via Docker Compose. End-to-end walkthrough lives in
[`deploy/README.md`](./deploy/README.md); the artifacts are:

- [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) — multi-stage build that publishes the WASM client and
  the API server into a single ASP.NET runtime image.
- [`deploy/compose.yaml`](./deploy/compose.yaml) — three-service topology with named
  volumes for postgres data and image uploads.
- [`deploy/Caddyfile`](./deploy/Caddyfile) — TLS termination, reverse proxy to the API
  container, raw-body passthrough on the Stripe webhook path.
- [`deploy/.env.example`](./deploy/.env.example) — full secret/config inventory.

The architecture accommodates the eventual managed-services move without code
changes: the `IImageStorage` abstraction has an R2 stub ready to wire (just add
`AWSSDK.S3` and implement); Postgres is reached via a connection string so swapping
to a managed instance is a single env-var change; Hangfire runs in-process today but
its `EnableServer` flag splits worker from web tier when load justifies it.
